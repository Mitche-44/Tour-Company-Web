##  Tour-Company-Web CLI Application

**Tour-Company-Web** is a Python command-line interface (CLI) application designed to efficiently manage an ecotourism companyâ€™s operations. The system allows users to create, read, update, and delete records related to tour packages and customer bookings. It uses SQLAlchemy ORM for database interactions and Alembic for handling schema migrations, following best practices for clean, modular, and maintainable code architecture. This tool helps streamline booking management and tour package administration for an ecotourism business.

##  Features

1. Full **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for:
- Tour Packages
- Customer Bookings

2. Additional functionality:
- Associate a booking with a specific tour package
- View all bookings per tour
- Modular CLI menus
- Input validation and error handling

---



##  Technologies Used

- Python
- SQLAlchemy
- Alembic (for schema migrations)
- Pipenv (for environment management)

---

##  Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```

git clone https://github.com/Mitche-44/Tour-Company-Web

cd Tour-Company-Web
```
### 2.Create and Activate Virtual Environment
```
pipenv install

pipenv install SQLAlchemy


pipenv shell
```
### 3.Install Required Dependencies
If using Pipenv, dependencies should be installed automatically.
If using pip, install the core packages manually:

```
pip install alembic

alembic init alembic/ alembic init migrations

alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial migration"      #This  will create a table

```
### 4. Run Database Migrations
```
alembic upgrade head

Or, if initializing manually:

python

from models import Base
from database.engine import engine

Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
```

### 5. Seed the Database 
```
python seed.py
```

### 6. Launch the CLI Application

```
python run.py

Youâ€™ll see a menu like:
===Welcome to Ace Ecotours CLI ===
1. List Tour Packages
2. Add Tour Package
3. Delete Tour Package
4. List Bookings
5. Add Booking
6. Delete Booking
7. Update Booking
8. Exit
```

| destination | String   | Tour destination            |
| price       | Decimal  | Tour price                  |
| duration    | Integer  | Tour duration in days       |
| description | Text     | Tour description            |
| created\_at | DateTime | Record creation timestamp   |



 ### Table: Booking
| Column             | Type     | Description                   |
